# Monoid-annotated 2-3 Finger Trees in R

Alpha tests on monoid-annotated fingertrees in R. Please note that this repository is very much an alpha work-in-progress; code is 
inefficient, functionality is missing.

`monoids.R` - experimentations with monoid annotated trees (not 2-3 finger trees)

`monoids_types.R` - experimentations with monoid annotated trees (not 2-3 finger trees), but with strong typing provided by `lambda.r` (helps with translating from Haskell examples from the original paper)

`fingertree.R` - experimentations with 2-3 finger trees (annotation largely supported, but not finished or tested)
